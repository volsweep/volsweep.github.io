&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The New York Police Department's, "Stop, Question, Frisk," program is featuring prominently in the &#8594;[news]({{ site.url }}/assets/FECpt2/google_trends.png)&#8592; recently. We examined the data from NYC OpenData a few years ago and resurrected the project to share an observation or two. All relevant code is in &#8594;[this](https://github.com/volsweep/volsweep.github.io/tree/master/projects/NYPD/SQF)&#8592; GitHub repository. Data are &#8594;[here](http://www1.nyc.gov/site/nypd/stats/reports-analysis/stopfrisk.page)&#8592;.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The histogram below has bins that are one week wide (52 per year).  The numbers in the legend are the all-time frequency counts per race from 2003 through 2019. Not shown in this plot are: Asian/Pacific Islander (156,925), Native American (19,991), Other/unknown (219,848).
